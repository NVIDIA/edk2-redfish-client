# How to build (Ubuntu Environment)
## Prerequisite
### Install packages
```
apt-get update; apt-get install install gcc g++ make uuid-dev nasm
```
If the `nasm` installed above shows build error during build process, we need to install
newer version of `nasm` manually:
- Download `nasm`
  ```
  wget https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.15rc12/nasm-2.15rc12.tar.gz"
  ```
- Extract file
  ```
  tar zxvf nasm-2.15rc12.tar.gz"
  ```
- Build and install `nasm`
  ```
  cd nasm-2.15rc12
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  sudo make install
  ```
- Check to see if `nasm` reports desired version or not
  ```
  nasm -v
  ```
### Build EDKII base tools
- Initial submodule (skip this if you already did this)
  ```
  git submodule update --init
  ```
- Build base tools
  ```
  cd BaseTools
  make
  ```
## Build RedfishClientPkg
In order to reference RedfishClientPkg, we need to set `PACKAGES_PATH` and specify the location
of edk2-redfish-client repository.
```
export PACKAGES_PATH=$PWD/edk2:$PWD/edk2-redfish-client
cd $PWD/edk2
. ./edksetup.sh
build -p RedfishClientPkg/RedfishClientPkg.dsc -t GCC5 -a X64
```
